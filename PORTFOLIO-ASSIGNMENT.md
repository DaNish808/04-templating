# Portfolio Assignment for Class 4 - Templates

Use what you learned in the class 4 lecture to improve the structure of your Portfolio app codebase.

## User Stories: MVP
1. As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.
- As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.

## User Stories: Stretch Goal
1. As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
  - Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a [type scale](http://type-scale.com/)(another good [type scale article](http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography)).
  - Include some good fonts, that work well together.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Add Handlebars to your blogging system.
 - Organize your CSS code according to SMACSS, with at least a file for base, layout, and modules.
 - Include an `.eslintrc` file and make sure you pass.  [Here's one](https://gist.github.com/sajoy/05ede1c681bfa59d1295f55290c7a795) you can use as an example; feel free to add or remove rules as you'd like.
